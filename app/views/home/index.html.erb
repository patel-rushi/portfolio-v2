        I prefer not to limit myself to just one profession; 
        I often engage in multiple tasks that are completely different 
        but necessary for the job. I fundamentally believe that having 
        the right mindset is essential for producing exceptional work in any field.

        <p>I work best with down-to-earth, inspiring people, and technically with

        and plain <b>(S)CSS</b>. 
        Plus, I have a keen eye for making designs look just right.</p>
