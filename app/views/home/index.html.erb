    <p>I'm a seeker, who's on a quest for truth,

    <div>Professionally, I am drawn to the art of creation, 
    which manifests in my role as a

    <p>
        I prefer not to limit myself to just one profession; 
        I often engage in multiple tasks that are different 
        but necessary for the job. 
        I believe that having the right mindset is essential for producing exceptional work in any field.
        I also try to leave things in better shape than I found them.

        <p>I work best with down-to-earth, inspiring people, and technically with 
        <b>Ruby on Rails</b>, 
        <b>React</b>, 
        plain <b>JavaScript</b>, 
        and plain <b>(S)CSS</b>. 
        Plus, I have a keen eye for making designs look just right!</p>
